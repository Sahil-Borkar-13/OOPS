        " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming in Python is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating reusable and structured code using classes and objects. A class works as a blueprint, while an object is an instance created from it. OOP provides core features like encapsulation to protect data, inheritance to reuse code across classes, polymorphism to use the same function in different ways, and abstraction to hide unnecessary details. These concepts help in writing clean, modular, and easily maintainable code. Overall, OOP in Python makes complex applications easier to build by breaking them down into smaller, real-world objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        "  - A class in Object-Oriented Programming is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties (data/attributes) and behaviors (functions/methods) that the objects created from it will have. In simple terms, a class provides the structure and rules, while the objects are actual instances based on that structure. By using classes, we can organize code better, promote reusability, and model real-world entities more effectively in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "  - An object in Object-Oriented Programming is an instance of a class, meaning it is created based on the structure defined by that class. Each object contains its own data (attributes) and can perform actions through methods defined inside the class. Objects allow us to represent real-world entities in a program, and multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with unique values. In simple terms, a class is the blueprint, and an object is the actual usable entity built from that blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "  - Abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user, which makes the system easier to use and understand. For example, when we use a car, we only interact with the steering and pedals without knowing how the engine works internally. Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access to that data using access modifiers. This helps protect the data from unauthorized modification and enhances security. In simple terms, abstraction focuses on what an object does, while encapsulation focuses on how the data and methods are kept safe and organized.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "  - Dunder methods in Python, also known as “magic methods” or “special methods,” are built-in methods that start and end with double underscores, such as __ init__, __ str__, and __ len__. These methods allow developers to define how objects of a class should behave in certain situations, like object creation, printing, comparison, or arithmetic operations. Python automatically calls these methods behind the scenes, providing powerful customization and operator overloading capabilities. In simple terms, dunder methods help integrate custom classes smoothly with Python’s built-in features.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "  - Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming is a mechanism that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class. The class that inherits is called the child (or subclass), and the class being inherited from is called the parent (or superclass). Through inheritance, we can reuse existing code, avoid duplication, and extend functionality by adding new features to the child class. It also helps in building hierarchical relationships between classes. Overall, inheritance improves code organization, promotes reusability, and makes programs easier to maintain and scale.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming is the ability of a function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the object or context in which it is used. It allows different classes to define methods with the same name but with their own specific implementations. This helps achieve flexibility and makes code easier to extend and maintain. For example, a draw() method may work differently for shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, even though the method name is the same. In simple terms, polymorphism allows one interface to handle multiple forms, improving code reusability and reducing complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and related methods inside a single class and restricting direct access to that data from outside the class. Python uses access modifiers like single underscore _ and double underscore __ to control access to variables. A single underscore indicates that a variable is intended for internal use, while a double underscore makes it private through name mangling, preventing accidental modification. To access or update these private variables safely, we use getter and setter methods. This approach helps protect sensitive data and improves security, maintainability, and control over how variables are used.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. It is defined using the __ init__() method inside a class and is automatically called at the time of object creation. Constructors allow us to assign initial values to object properties and set up the necessary state for the object to work properly. By using constructors, we ensure that each object starts with valid and meaningful data, improving reliability and consistency in Object-Oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "  - Class methods and static methods in Python are special types of methods that provide different ways to work with class data. A class method is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first parameter, allowing it to access or modify class-level variables shared by all objects. It can be called using either the class name or an object. On the other hand, a static method is defined using the @staticmethod decorator and does not take self or cls as its first parameter. It behaves like a normal function inside a class and is used when some processing is related to the class but does not need access to class or instance data. Both methods help in organizing utility functions and improving code structure in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "  - Method overloading in Python means using one method name to perform different tasks based on the number of arguments we pass. Python doesn’t officially support traditional method overloading like some other languages, but we can achieve similar behavior by using default values or *args inside a method. This way, the same method can work with one, two, or more arguments. It helps make the code cleaner and easier to read because we don’t need to create separate methods for similar tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "  - Method overriding in OOP occurs when a child class provides its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class. The method name and parameters remain the same, but the child class changes the behavior to suit its needs. When we create an object of the child class, Python automatically calls the overridden method instead of the parent class’s method. Method overriding is mainly used to achieve polymorphism and allows us to customize or extend the functionality of inherited methods in a more meaningful way.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "  - A property decorator in Python is used to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It allows us to control how a value is returned, set, or deleted without directly accessing the variable. By using the @property decorator, we can create getter methods that make the code cleaner and more readable, while still protecting the internal data of the class. Property decorators are commonly used to add validation or processing when accessing or modifying attributes, helping to achieve encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows the same method or function to behave differently based on the object that is using it. This makes programs more flexible and easier to extend, since we can write one piece of code that works with many different types of objects. It also improves readability and reduces duplication, because we don’t need to create separate methods for every class. Polymorphism helps achieve loose coupling, making code easier to maintain, update, and scale in larger applications.\n",
        "\n",
        " 15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to provide a base or template for other classes. It can contain abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented, forcing the child classes to provide their own implementation. Abstract classes are created using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator. They are useful when we want to define a common structure or behavior across multiple classes while ensuring that each subclass implements specific methods. This helps maintain consistency and supports a clear design in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
        "\n",
        " 16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "  - One major benefit of OOP is code reusability, because we can use classes and inheritance to avoid writing the same code again. OOP also improves modularity, as programs are divided into smaller objects, making them easier to understand and manage. With encapsulation, data is protected and controlled through methods, increasing security and reducing errors. Polymorphism adds flexibility by allowing one interface to work in different ways. Overall, OOP makes code more maintainable, scalable, and easier to debug, especially in large and complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from more than one parent class. This means a single child class can access attributes and behaviors of multiple classes at the same time. It helps in situations where we want to combine functionality from different classes into one. However, it must be used carefully because it can create confusion if parent classes have methods with the same name. Python handles this using the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to decide which method to call first.\n",
        "\n",
        " 18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "  - The main difference between a class variable and an instance variable is how and where they are stored. A class variable is shared by all objects of the class, meaning any change to it affects every instance. It is defined inside the class but outside any method. An instance variable, on the other hand, belongs to a specific object and is defined inside the constructor (__ init__) or other instance methods. Each object gets its own separate copy of instance variables, so changing the value in one object does not affect others. In simple terms, class variables are common to all objects, while instance variables are unique for each object.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19 .Explain the purpose of ‘’__ str__’ and ‘__ repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "  - The __ str__ and __ repr__ methods in Python are special methods used to control how objects are represented as strings. The __ str__ method is meant to return a human-readable and user-friendly string representation of an object, which is mainly used when printing the object. On the other hand, __ repr__ is designed to return a more detailed and unambiguous string representation, usually meant for developers and debugging. Ideally, the output of __ repr__ should be clear enough to recreate the object. If __ str__ is not defined, Python automatically falls back to using __ repr__.\n",
        "\n",
        " 20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from the parent class inside a child class. It helps us access and reuse the parent class’s properties and behavior without writing the code again. super() is commonly used in inheritance, especially inside the constructor (__ init__), to properly initialize the parent class before adding extra features in the child class. It also helps avoid duplication and makes the code easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        " 21. What is the significance of the __ del__ method in Python\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or deleted from memory. The main purpose of the __del__ method is to perform cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing resources, or freeing up memory before the object is removed. Although Python has an automatic garbage collector that handles most memory management tasks, defining a __ del__ method can be useful when we need to manually handle resource cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        " 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "  - The main difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python is how they are used and what they can access. A classmethod receives the class itself as the first argument, usually named cls, which means it can access or modify class-level variables that are shared among all objects. It is useful when we want to work with the class as a whole. A staticmethod, on the other hand, does not receive self or cls as the first argument. It behaves like a normal function placed inside a class only for organizational purposes. It cannot access or modify class or instance data directly. In short, @classmethod works with the class, while @staticmethod is just a utility function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows a child class to provide its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class. When we create an object of the child class and call that method, Python automatically runs the child class’s version, even if the reference is of the parent type. This behavior lets the same method name work differently depending on the object that calls it, making the code flexible and easier to extend. Polymorphism through inheritance is mainly achieved using method overriding, where child classes customize or change the behavior of inherited methods.\n",
        "\n",
        " 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. This is possible when each method returns the object itself, usually by returning self. Method chaining helps make the code more readable and compact, especially when performing a sequence of operations on the same object. It is commonly used in builder patterns, configurations, and data processing steps. By returning self, each method call continues to operate on the same instance, allowing smooth chaining of multiple actions.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 25. What is the purpose of the __ call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __ call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an object to be called like a function. When this method is defined inside a class, we can use the object’s name followed by parentheses to execute the code inside __ call__. This makes objects more flexible and can be useful for tasks like creating function-like objects, callbacks, or customizing behavior. In simple terms, __ call__ lets an object behave as if it were a function."
